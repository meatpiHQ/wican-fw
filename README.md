# **API**
[API Documentation](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qJelUAHGrn_YbNIP0Jk_KmNENG-hKbtl?usp=sharing)

[Programing examples](https://github.com/meatpiHQ/programming_examples/tree/master/CAN)

# **Build**:

1. Install ESP-IDF v4.4.
2. Clone porject.
3. Open project and build.

# **Description**:

WiCAN is a powerful ESP32-C3-based CAN adapter for car hacking and general CAN-bus development. It is available in two form factors, OBD-II and standard USB-CAN. The original firmware can use Wi-Fi or BLE to interface directly with RealDash, which allows you to create your own custom dashboards with stunning graphics. It is available for Android, iOS, and Windows 10. WiCAN connects to your existing Wi-Fi network and any device on that network, where it allows you to configure Wi-Fi and CAN settings through a built-in web interface. Both versions have a power-saving mode that detects when the voltage drops under 13 V or some other preset value. When this power-saving mode is engaged, WiCAN is capable of entering sleep mode, which drops current consumption below 1 mA.

WiCAN is a simple, ready-to-use solution for CAN-bus development and hacking. It accelerates development by providing vehicle-diagnostic APIs and libraries in various languages and for various operating systems. WiCAN works with a large array of pre-existing vehicle-diagnostic libraries, including RealDash, SavvyCAN, BUSmaster, python-can/SocketCA, and more. APIs are also available for LabView, C#, VB.Net, Delphi, and Python in case you’re writing your own software.

# WiCAN-OBD
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94690098/231444160-08842087-55ad-4165-8291-b379da63aeeb.png)

WiCAN-OBD will be of great interest to car enthusiasts and tinkers who want to modernize or customize the head-unit displays in their cars using RealDash. Check out some examples of the available graphic interfaces, which are supported by a robust collection of Manuals & Tutorials to get you started with RealDash.

Another great feature of WiCAN-OBD is its MQTT battery alerts. It can monitor your battery voltage and send an alert if that voltage drops under a set threshold. This feature is especially important for users who own multiple cars they do not use regularly.

# WiCAN-USB
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94690098/231443956-fbf2de46-ef19-4ba5-83b1-6058ab123f56.png)

WiCAN-USB can be powered through USB or through a screw-terminal connector. The hardware and firmware is almost identical to WiCAN-OBD, but with an extended voltage range up to 36 V. Many of the projects we work on involve 12 V or 24 V trucks, and WiCAN-USB comes in handy when we need to monitor those trucks remotely, from the comfort of our desks, by configuring them to connect to Wi-Fi. And, thanks to its low cost, we don’t need to worry about breaking or losing it the WiCAN-USB device itself.

WiCAN-USB can also be used as a USB-to-CAN adapter when Wi-Fi connectivity is not available or when a hardwired connection is needed.

# WiCAN-USB as a USB-to-CAN adapter

Traditional USB-to-CAN connectors are often expensive and do not always offer optimal efficiency. In contrast, the ESP32-based WiCAN presents a readily available and cost-effective solution, making it an excellent choice for low-frequency CAN bus applications and providing great value for its cost.

Although WiCAN performs well for low-frequency data transmission, it may not be suitable for all frequency ranges. Nonetheless, it excels in many applications, particularly those with less demanding data rates.

Integrating WiCAN into your setup is straightforward and economical, requiring either customised shields for your ESP-32 module or merely jumper wires. With minimal expense, you can significantly enhance your system's capabilities.

## Code Customization
## Setup Guide

## [**Programming Examples**](https://github.com/meatpiHQ/programming_examples/tree/master/CAN)

### **Features and Specifications**:

- Supports CAN2.0A/B up to 1Mbits.
- Works with Realdash, based on "realdash 66"
- Supports SocketCAN and works with BUSMaster
- Supports TCP and UDP
- WiFi can be used in AP and station mode
- WiFi and CAN configured using web interface.
- Diode protection for the USB port

![Modes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94690098/222961571-bd137341-808a-4f0a-9528-789fe24d640e.png "Connection Mode")

# Features:
--------

## 1. Sleep Mode:

WiCAN can be permanently attached to the car without worrying about draining the battery. It monitors the battery voltage and can detect when the alternator is ON. When the engine is ON the battery continuously charging and the voltage will be about 13.5V(can vary with different car models). When the engine is OFF the battery voltage drops to about 12.8V(full battery) -  WiCAN can detect this drop, and if the voltage remains under the threshold for **3 min** it will go to sleep and the current consumption will drop below **1mA**. If the engine is turned ON it will immediately wake up and enable the WiFi/BLE. 
The threshold voltage is configurable and can be set in the configuration page, the default value is 13V. 

## 2. Battery Alert:

This is an important feature for most car enthusiast who own multiple cars that are only driven few times a year.  Basically if a car is not used in few month the battery will go flat and needs to be jumped. WiCAN can be configured to send an alert when the battery voltage drops under a certain level. Sleep mode has to be enabled for this feature to be useful. **For now alerts can be sent on MQTT, more protocols are coming soon. If there is a specific protocol you want to be supported let me know.**

# MQTT

## If you're using firmware verion v1.64 or below please update to the [latest version](https://github.com/meatpiHQ/wican-fw/releases/) before enabling MQTT

Currently only non-secure MQTT is supported, it's highly recommended that you only use it with local MQTT broker and not use public brokers otherwise your CAN bus might be publicly exposed.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94690098/196186799-7299fe23-8d98-40e0-ad72-a4aeaf695110.png)

To use MQTT client simply Enable in the configuration page and fill in the broker details. You also need to note the device ID, which will be used to communicate with the device. The device ID "xxxxxxxxxxxx" is part of the AP ssid mentioned in [WiFi/CAN Configuration](#1-wifican-configuration) WiCAN_xxxxxxxxxxxx. This will alow you to communicate with multiple WiCAN device if needed.

Example: If the AP ssid is "WiCAN_112233445566", the device ID is 112233445566. 

## 1. Status:  

When the device connects to the MQTT broker it will publish a status message to the status topic.

### - Status Topic: wican/xxxxxxxxxxxx/status
### - Status Message JSON:  

{"status": "offline"} or {"status": "online"}

## 2. MQTT TX RX Frame:

```
bus: Is always 0. Thats reserved for future application
type: tx or rx 
dlc: 0 to 8
rtr: true or false
extd: true or false
id: 11 or 29 bit ID
```
**Example:** { "bus": "0", "type": "tx", "frame": [{ "id": 2015, "dlc": 8, "rtr": false, "extd": false, "data": [2, 1, 70, 170, 170, 170, 170, 170] }] };

## 3. Receive Frames:

To receive CAN frames simply subscribe to the receive topic. Each MQTT message might contain more than 1 frame.

### - Receive Topic: wican/xxxxxxxxxxxx/can/rx
### - Received Message JSON: 

{"bus":0,"type":"rx","ts":34610,"frame":[{"id":123,"dlc":8,"rtr":false,"extd":false,"data":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]},{"id":124,"dlc":8,"rtr":false,"extd":true,"data":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]}]}
### - Received Message JSON Schema:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94690098/196184692-40c84504-580c-449f-9876-3d373dd11560.png)

## 4. Transmit Frames:

### - Transmit Topic: wican/xxxxxxxxxxxx/can/tx
### - Transmit Message JSON: 
{"bus":0,"type":"tx","frame":[{"id":123,"dlc":8,"rtr":false,"extd":true,"data":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]},{"id":124,"dlc":8,"rtr":false,"extd":true,"data":[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]}]}

### - Transmit Message JSON Schema:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94690098/196187228-3923204e-1b87-4ece-bb72-406e338a5831.png)

## 5. OBDII PID Request Over MQTT

```
bus: Is always 0. Reserved for future application
dlc: Always 8
rtr: false
extd: false, if the car obd2 protocol is 11bit ID, 500 kbaud or 250 kbaud
extd: true, if the car obd2 protocol is 29bit ID, 500 kbaud or 250 kbaud
id: 11 bit OBD2 request ECU ID should be 2015 (that's 0x7DF in HEX)
id: 29 bit OBD2 request ECU ID should be 417018865 (that's 0x18DB33F1 in HEX)
```

![image](https://github.com/meatpiHQ/wican-fw/assets/94690098/7726d4fe-1d6f-4b1e-be93-ea4304a47942)

### Example: Get ambient temp request, PID is 70

{ "bus": "0", "type": "tx", "frame": [{ "id": 2015, "dlc": 8, "rtr": false, "extd": false, "data": [2, 1, 70, 170, 170, 170, 170, 170] }] };

### [List of Standard PIDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OBD-II_PIDs) 

## 6. Request Battery SoC MQTT Example

This PID request should work on most EVs, **however it's not possible to know it will work on certain EV model unless it's tested on that specific car model**.

### Request 

{"bus":"0","type":"tx","frame":[{"id":2015,"dlc":8,"rtr":false,"extd":false,"data":[2,1,91,170,170,170,170,170]}]}

### Response

{"bus":"0","type":"rx","ts":51561,"frame":[{"id":2024,"dlc":8,"rtr":false,"extd":false,"data":[3,65,91,**170**,0,0,0,0]}]}

The SoC = (170 x 100)/255 = **66.67%**

## 7. CAN to JSON interpreter - Filtring 


This feature enables you to convert CAN messages into JSON format, apply calculations as specified by your expressions, and send the resulting data to an MQTT broker at predefined intervals. Below, we provide a comprehensive guide on how to effectively utilize this powerful feature.

**Note: When a filter is added, all other CAN messages will be ignored, ensuring that only the configured filtered messages are sent.**

![image](https://github.com/meatpiHQ/wican-fw/assets/94690098/a6588895-504e-48ef-9d3b-c595ced52ebd)


### Configuration Parameters:

**CAN ID: Frame ID in DEC**
This parameter refers to the CAN message identifier in decimal format.

**Name**
Specify the JSON key under which the extracted value will be stored.

**PID: PID Number in DEC**
If the frame is a response to a PID request, set this parameter to the relevant PID number. Otherwise, for non-PID frames, it should be set to -1.

**Start Bit**
Indicate the bit from which you want to commence extracting the value. For instance, if Byte 0 is represented as 0xA0 in binary (b1010 0000), 'Bit 0' would correspond to 1, 'Bit 1' to 0, and so forth.

**Bit Length**
This parameter denotes the number of bits comprising the value you intend to extract.

**Expression**
Define the mathematical operations to apply to the extracted value. It's crucial to include the letter 'V' to represent the extracted value within your expression.

**Cycle**
Specify the time interval in milliseconds between JSON messages sent to MQTT. The cycle time should fall within the range of 100 to 10,000 milliseconds.


### JSON Format 

WiCAN processes CAN frames, and the resulting JSON data follows this structure:

```
{"VehicleSpeed": 23.000000}
{"EngineSpeed": 1165.000000}
{"CustomID": 3594.400000}
```

### PID response frames Example:

Name|CAN ID| Byte 0 | Byte 1 | Byte 2 | Byte 3 | Byte 4 | Byte 5 | Byte 6 | Byte 7 
---|--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |--- |--- |--- |---
Engine Speed|2024| 4| 65| **12**| _18_| _52_| 170| 170| 170
| |  |  | | PID| Value 1| Value 2  |  |  

The Engine Speed is PID response so "PID" must be set 12. The value we need to extract is 16bit in Byte 3 and Byte 4. So we set the "Start Bit" to 24 and "Bit Length" to 16. The extracted value will be (11*256)+68 = 4660. Now to get the engine speed in rpm we must multiple by 0.25. So the "Expression" will be V*0.25= 1165

Name|CAN ID| Byte 0 | Byte 1 | Byte 2 | Byte 3 | Byte 4 | Byte 5 | Byte 6 | Byte 7 
---|--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |--- |--- |--- |---
Vehicle Speed|2024| 4| 65| **13**| _23_|170| 170| 170| 170
| |  |  | | PID| Value 1|   |  |  

The Vehicle  Speed is PID response so "PID" must be set 13. The value we need to extract is 8bit in Byte 3. So we set the "Start Bit" to 24 and "Bit Length" to 8. The extracted value will be 23. No need for any operation to get the speed so we set the "Expression" to V, so the value will be 23.

### Other CAN Frames Example:

Name|CAN ID| Byte 0 | Byte 1 | Byte 2 | Byte 3 | Byte 4 | Byte 5 | Byte 6 | Byte 7 
---|--- | --- | --- | --- |--- |--- |--- |--- |---
Custom ID|356| 170| 170| _35_| _16_|170| 170| 170| 170

The PID in the configuration needs to set to -1. The value we need to extract is 16bit in Byte 2 and Byte 3. So we set the "Start Bit" to 16 and "Bit Length" to 16. The extracted value will be (35*256)+16 = 8976. Now to get the value we must add 10 to the Value and divide by 2.5. So the "Expression" will be (V+10)/2.5 = 3594.4


# Home Assistant
WiCAN is able to send CAN bus messages to Home Assistant using MQTT protocol. I found that using Node-RED is the simplest way to create automation based on the CAN messages received. This short video highlights some of the steps https://youtu.be/oR5HQIUPR9I

1. Install Home Assistant [Mosquitto broker add-on](https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/blob/master/mosquitto/DOCS.md)
2. Create Home Assistant new user account for WiCAN. These user credentials will be used to set up the MQTT setting for WiCAN.
3. Connect to WiCAN access point WiCAN_xxxxxxxxxxxx then, using a web browser, go to http://192.168.80.1/
4. Set the "Mode" to Ap+Station
5. Fill in your Home WiFi network SSID and Password.
6. Enable [MQTT](#mqtt) and fill in the Home Assistant credentials created in step 2
7. Install Home Assistant [Node-RED Add-on](https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-node-red)
8. Download [wican_example_flow.json](https://github.com/meatpiHQ/wican-fw/blob/main/ha/wican_example_flow.json) and replace **device_id** with your WiCAN ID.
9. Open Node-RED Add-on and import the edited "wican_example_flow.json"
10. Double click on the subsction Node and edit the server fill in MQTT broker IP address and credentials created in step 2
11. Click deploy.
12. To create a new MQTT sensor, you’ll need to edit the configuration.yaml file by adding the following lines:

```
mqtt:
  sensor:
    - name: "Amb Temp"
      state_topic: "CAR1/Amb_Temp"
      unit_of_measurement: "C"
      value_template: "{{ value_json.amb_temp }}"
    - name: "Fuel Level"
      state_topic: "CAR1/Fuel_Level"
      unit_of_measurement: "%"
      value_template: "{{ value_json.fuel_level }}"
```
11. Restart Home assistant
12. After restart go to dashboard and Add new Card entity.

## Workflow summery

In this example we've got one Node subscribed to topic ``` wican/device_id/status ```, when WiCAN connects to the local network it will publish ``` {"status": "online"}  ```. Once the Node function ``` Send Get  Amb Temp req ``` receives online status it will send a OBD2 request to get the ambient temperature. The OBD2 request message looks like this:

``` { "bus": "0", "type": "tx", "frame": [{ "id": 2015, "dlc": 8, "rtr": false, "extd": false, "data": [2, 1, 70, 170, 170, 170, 170, 170] }] } ```

Frame ID : 2015 or 0x7DF
PID: 70 or 0x46

Here is a good [reference](https://www.csselectronics.com/pages/obd2-pid-table-on-board-diagnostics-j1979) on how to construct a PID request. Note select DEC from drop down list.

We have another Node subscribed to topic ``` wican/device_id/can/rx ```, once the car ECU responds to the request the function ``` Parse Amb Temp RSP ``` will parse the message and publish a message to topic ``` CAR1/Amb_Temp ```. Notice that when you edited ``` configuration.yaml ``` file create an MQTT Entity that subscribes to ``` CAR1/Amb_Temp ``` and expects a message ``` { value_json.amb_temp } ``` with unit_of_measurement C.
