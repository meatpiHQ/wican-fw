## Description

WiCAN, based on ESP32-C3, is a versatile CAN adapter for car hacking and CAN-bus development, available in OBD-II and USB-CAN formats. It uses Wi-Fi or BLE for interface with RealDash, allowing custom dashboards. It features a power-saving mode for low battery consumption and supports a range of vehicle-diagnostic APIs and libraries.

### WiCAN-OBD

- Ideal for car enthusiasts wanting to modernize head-unit displays.
- Supports RealDash for custom graphics interfaces.
- Sends battery alerts when voltage drops below a set threshold.

# WiCAN-USB
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/94690098/231443956-fbf2de46-ef19-4ba5-83b1-6058ab123f56.png)

WiCAN-USB can be powered through USB or through a screw-terminal connector. The hardware and firmware is almost identical to WiCAN-OBD, but with an extended voltage range up to 36 V. Many of the projects we work on involve 12 V or 24 V trucks, and WiCAN-USB comes in handy when we need to monitor those trucks remotely, from the comfort of our desks, by configuring them to connect to Wi-Fi. And, thanks to its low cost, we donâ€™t need to worry about breaking or losing it the WiCAN-USB device itself.

WiCAN-USB can also be used as a USB-to-CAN adapter when Wi-Fi connectivity is not available or when a hardwired connection is needed.

# WiCAN-USB as a USB-to-CAN adapter

Traditional USB-to-CAN connectors are often expensive and do not always offer optimal efficiency. In contrast, the ESP32-based WiCAN presents a readily available and cost-effective solution, making it an excellent choice for low-frequency CAN bus applications and providing great value for its cost.

Although WiCAN performs well for low-frequency data transmission, it may not be suitable for all frequency ranges. Nonetheless, it excels in many applications, particularly those with less demanding data rates.

Integrating WiCAN into your setup is straightforward and economical, requiring just a couple of customised shields for your ESP-32 module. With minimal expense, you can significantly enhance your system's capabilities.

## Code Customization
To make the baud rate compatible with the dev-kit we changed it from 3000000 to 4000000.

## Setup Guide

Follow these steps to set up your Wi-CAN module:

1. **Prepare the Hardware:**
   - Begin by creating two custom shields for your Wi-CAN module setup to facilitate future modifications. Details for these shields are provided in the attachments below.
   - Mount the ESP32 board onto the shields, ensuring correct pin configuration and secure connections.

2. **Flash the Firmware onto the ESP32 Board:**
   - Clone the `wican-fw` repository from `meatpi`:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/meatpiHQ/wican-fw.git
     ```

   - Open the cloned project in Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
   - Install the latest version of the **ESP-IDF** extension:
     - Open the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`), search for **ESP-IDF**, and install it.
     - After installation, click **Configure Extension**.
        ![esp-idf1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34e827e9-0991-418e-8ab7-96eecda7a1d2)
       
     - Select the **Express** installation option.
        ![esp-idf2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/31df3fa8-c21d-4de2-90e4-3f728e8c3095)
       
     - Enable the **Show all ESP-IDF tags** option, choose **v5.1 (release version)** from the dropdown menu, and click **Install**.
        ![esp-idf3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cbc6f50c-2575-4ef4-b49a-6cea8814b340)
       
   - Navigate to the **ESP-IDF: Explorer** on the left-hand side.
     - Choose **Full Clean** to remove any pre-existing build files.
     - Click **Build** to compile the firmware.
     - Select the appropriate serial port by clicking **Select Serial Port**.
     - Erase any existing firmware on the board by selecting **Erase Flash**.
     - Once the project is built, click **Flash** to upload the firmware to your ESP32 board.

   Your module is now ready for use!

3. **Connect the Module to Your Laptop:**
   - Connect the setup module to your laptop using a USB to micro-USB cable.
   - Attach the CAN connector to one of the custom shields. The other end of the CAN cable should connect to the device that will provide the required CAN data.

4. **Configure the CAN Interface:**
   - Run the following commands in your terminal to configure the CAN interface and receive data:

     ```bash
     sudo slcand -o -s8 -t sw -S 3000000 /dev/ttyUSB0 can0
     ```

     > **Tip:** Press `Tab` after typing `/dev/ttyUSB` to automatically select the correct port.

     ```bash
     sudo ifconfig can0 txqueuelen 1000
     ```

     Configures the transmit queue length for the `can0` interface.

     ```bash
     sudo ifconfig can0 up
     ```

     Activates the `can0` network interface.

     ```bash
     candump -c -ta -x can0
     ```

     Use this command to receive CAN messages.
