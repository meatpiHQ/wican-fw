## How to Export Car Scanner Logs

Logs can be useful if you are looking for specific sensor data and plan to automate WiCAN to capture this data automatically.

### Steps to Export Logs:
1. **[Set up Car Scanner](https://meatpihq.github.io/wican-fw/car_scanner/usage)**:
   - Ensure that Car Scanner is correctly configured and connected to WiCAN.

2. **Connect to WiCAN**:
   - Follow the standard connection procedure outlined earlier.

3. **Access Sensor Data**:
   - Once connected, press **All Sensors** to view the available sensors.

4. **Select the Sensor of Interest**:
   - Tap on the sensor you wish to log data from.

5. **Log Data**:
   - Let the app log data for a few seconds to capture sufficient readings.

6. **Note the Sensor Value**:
   - During the logging process, observe and note the current value of the sensor you are monitoring.  
     This ensures you have a reference for the captured data.

7. **Preserve the Last Reading**:
   - Immediately remove WiCAN from the OBD-II port after logging.  
     This ensures that the last recorded data corresponds to the required sensor.

8. **Export Logs**:
   - Navigate to **Settings -> Adapter OBDII ELM327**, scroll to the bottom, and press **Export Logs**.


The exported logs will contain the recorded data for further analysis or automation with WiCAN.
