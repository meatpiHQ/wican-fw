# ⚠️ Important Note

**Disclaimer:**  
The list below is primarily based on **user submissions**. Vehicle profiles are **tested and verified** through user feedback.  
Before ordering a **WiCAN adapter**, please review the following important notes:

- For **detailed information on compatibility with specific makes and models**, you can search the relevant **GitHub issues**. Users often report experiences and others share helpful tips—it's a great resource for troubleshooting and identifying vehicle-specific behavior.

---

### 1. **WiCAN PRO Recommended**

We **highly recommend** ordering the **WiCAN PRO** version because:

- It features an **advanced OBD chip**, improving compatibility with a wider range of vehicles.
- You’ll receive **access to the latest features** and **firmware updates**.
- It offers **better long-term support** compared to the standard WiCAN **because of memory limitations on the original WiCAN hardware**.

---

### 2. **Vehicle Alarm Triggers**

On some vehicles, leaving an **OBD adapter** connected and **polling the ECU** while the car is **off** may **trigger the vehicle’s alarm**.

- This behavior is **controlled by the vehicle’s firmware**.
- In some cases, this feature **can be disabled** in the car’s settings.
- In other cases, there may be **no option to turn it off**.

# 🚗 Vehicle Support Overview

WiCAN **vehicle profiles** are available for various models listed below. These profiles include **vehicle-specific parameters**—especially for **electric vehicles**—but also occasionally for **standard (non-electric)** models (e.g., **odometer readings**, **fuel levels**).

In most **electric, hybrid, and standard vehicles**, a set of **standard OBD-II PIDs** is supported—but the availability of these PIDs depends on the **make and model**:

- Some manufacturers **disable certain standard PIDs**.
- Others **override or replace** them with **proprietary, manufacturer-specific PIDs**.
- For this reason, even vehicles from the same brand can offer **different data access**.

You can try scanning available **standard PIDs** using the **Automate** tab:

### 💡 Tip for Vehicle-Specific Info

When you're curious about whether your vehicle is supported or how it behaves with WiCAN:

- **Search GitHub issues** for your vehicle’s make and model.
- Many users share firsthand experiences, common pitfalls, and working configurations.
